               Flowers come in various forms, shapes, and sizes, making them an essential component of Earth’s biodiversity. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-next-two">They serve as the reproductive organs for plants and are usually composed of male and female reproductive structures such as stamens and pistils. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-next-three">
               Some plants produce large, single flowers, like poppies, magnolias, tulips, and petunias, while others bear smaller flowers in clusters, known as inflorescences, like asters, snapdragons, and lilacs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-next-four">In the majority of species, individual flowers have both male (stamens) and female (pistils) parts. These flowers are referred to as perfect, bisexual, or hermaphrodite. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-next-five">Yet, some species contain imperfect or unisexual flowers, featuring only male or female reproductive organs.
